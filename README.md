We are working on a project for maggie's.

Challenges:  
1.  No visitor should be aware that information pertinent to their visit is being recorded. The solution should be simple and easy to use by a largely non technical staff.  
2. Not double count any one visitor. 
3. Ease of Use. 
4. Allow Reporting. Key reports would identify the number of unique visitors to a centre, the number of services leveraged in a center and trends.  

What we have done:  
1. A webpage for the staff to login in, avoid other people accessing the webpage.  
2. A webpage for the staff to submit information to the system.  
3. A webpage showing the all the information of today's record.  
3. Save these data to a database.  
4. Generate tables and charts from databases.
