We are working on a project for maggie's.

Challenges:  
1. Maintain the Maggies ethos. No visitor should be aware that information pertinent to their visit is being recorded. As a result of this, the staff are required to recall much of the conversation from memory afterward (and they may talk to other visitors in between) so the solution should be simple and easy to use by a largely non technical staff.  
2. Not double count any one visitor. A visitor may talk to multiple specialists in the center in a single visit. The visitor may utilize different skills/services from each member of staff so it’s important that the usage is recorded but that it’s not attributed to a ‘new’ visitor, rather collated under the same individual.  
3. Ease of Use. The solution should be easy for our staff to accurately capture information without extensive data entry and without using excels or a paper based process.  
4. Allow Reporting. The solution should be easy to report on and easy to cut the captured information in a variety of ways. Key reports would identify the number of unique visitors to a centre, the number of services leveraged in a center and trends.  

What we have done:  
1. A webpage for the staff to login in, avoid other people accessing the webpage.  
2. A webpage for the staff to submit information to the system.  
3. A webpage showing the all the information of today's record.  
3. Save these data to a database.  
4. Generate tables and charts from databases.
